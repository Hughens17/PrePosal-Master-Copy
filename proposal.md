# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I will title the project Funny Website. If I can I will call the website LaughCity.com or something like that. 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project will use HTML to create a funny website with all kinds of funny things. I especially want to focus on links and making those links do funny and tricky things. 
## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use the HTML to create a website and really play with the different stlyes that are available. I mainly want to implement funny and random internet videos. The site is meant to look really childish and silly because I want it to be a place where one can get a good laugh by interacting with the websites. Maybe some links can be traps that create random popups. It is meant to be interactive so I am thinking of creating a mad libs game using dictionaries if possible. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

No other course will be combined for this project. 
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

No collaborators.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

If nothing else, I really want to create a functional and detailed website. It has to look fun and inviting but I mainly want to experiment with different styles. I am not sure about the madlibs game just yet I think that will just add to the random humor theme that I am going with.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I really want to implement what I learned about links to make the website fun and interactive. Apparently I can create traps and add easter eggs. I want the website to branch out to other existing sites where users can access funny internet videos. I want to expand my knowledge to other coding languages that will facilitate more demandning and specialized tasks.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

In my final project I want to acquire more knowledge as we have not really worked with HTML. This is a relatively new track that I can delve into. I hope that I can really apply the knowledge that I have obtained from this project to create more sophisticated projects and give me the confidence to take on other topics that I am really interested in.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will be working alone on this project. HTML will be new for me but I am currently using Harvard's CS50 course to learn some of the basics about web design. I just finished learning about IP addresses and port numbers. I think I may need to learn about CSS as well to style the web pages in the way that I want which is critical for my chosen project. I also need to research JAVA to make my webpage more interactive. Right now I am just in the research phase. I used headers and footers on Visual Studio Code (which I just downloaded to create a basic layout for a website. I was also able to create a link that takes me to another page. I feel like I am really getting somewhere so far.
